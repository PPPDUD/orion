# IMPORTANT - DEPRECATION NOTICE
As of March 16th, 2025, all code in this repository is deprecated.
Much of it was provided by LLMs and likely contains unfixed bugs.

If you hold a token that was based off of this codebase, you should consider migrating your finances as soon as possible.
There are ZERO official instances of Orion Kitty on the Ethereum blockchain. Do not fall for scams; malicious smart contracts could steal your funds with no chance of getting them back.

If you have discovered a vulnerability in this code, please do not bug me about it. Go tell a security company about it or write a post on your blog.
This product is abandoned and you should feel no obligation to keep any security vulnerabilities here hidden from the public eye.

All support of Orion Kitty on the Ethereum chain has been suspended. If you work for a business that has previously offered support for this product, consider halting future help.

This product should not be confused with Orion (a stablecoin that is completely unrelated to me) or Orion Kitty on the Solana chain (which is not deprecated).
